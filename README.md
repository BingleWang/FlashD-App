## Introduction: 
The goal of this project is to develop a web application. It is a one-hour same-city delivery application that will allow users to quickly find a courier to help deliver their items when needed and to track the current status of the items delivered. The application will also help to secure a steady flow of delivery requests from couriers in the city who need this employment. The project will be carried out by researching requirements and background searches, designing production features, and selecting the appropriate development technology to complete the project. It concludes with a retrospective reflection on the whole project and an expansion of ideas for future work.
